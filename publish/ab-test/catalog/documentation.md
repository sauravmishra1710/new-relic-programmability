## Documentation

This application combines and presents data from New Relic and the Nerdsletter API so that we can make an informed decision on which design version results in more high-quality newsletter subscriptions.

It also presents an button to end the test, which saves the date and version descriptions in local storage.

We can use this app for future A/B tests as well!
